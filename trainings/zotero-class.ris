AB  - We like to think that our work speaks for itself and that the visual appeal of our presentations has no effect on the audience’s reception of the content. In reality, the design of your presentation plays a major role in what your audience sees, what they focus on, and how they perceive your message. One study, by New York University Professor Jan L. Plass and others, showed that an attractive visual design (through layout, colors, and imagery) can help evoke positive emotions and foster learning. Employing great design in a technical presentation is not about making your slides “pop” or

AB  - If you’ve followed the strategies presented so far, you now have a presentation that features less text, clean data visualizations designed to focus audience attention, and images intended to support your points and engage your viewers. With all of this in place, there is one final family of slides—what I call scaffolding slides—that will ensure your audience is able to follow your argument and understand your message. The purpose of scaffolding slides is to guide and focus your audience’s attention as you transition from one section to another, and to drive home important points. They act as scaffolding

AB  - Retinal function has long been studied with psychophysical methods in humans, whereas detailed functional studies of vision have been conducted mostly in animals owing to the invasive nature of physiological approaches. There are exceptions to this generalization, for example, the electroretinogram. This review examines exciting recent advances using in vivo retinal imaging to understand the function of retinal neurons. In some cases, the methods have existed for years and are still being optimized. In others, new methods such as optophysiology are revealing novel patterns of retinal function in animal models that have the potential to change our understanding of the functional capacity of the retina. Together, the advances in retinal imaging mark an important milestone that shifts attention away from anatomy alone and begins to probe the function of healthy and diseased eyes.

T2  - Mathematical Biosciences
AB  - Advancing technologies, including interactive tools, are changing classroom pedagogy across academia. Here, we discuss the R Markdown interface, which allows for the creation of partial or complete interactive classroom modules for courses using the R programming language. R Markdown files mix sections of R code with formatted text, including LaTeX, which are rendered together to form complete reports and documents. These features allow instructors to create classroom modules that guide students through concepts, while providing areas for coding and text response by students. Students can also learn to create their own reports for more independent assignments. After presenting the features and uses of R Markdown to enhance teaching and learning, we present examples of materials from two courses. In a Computational Modeling course for math students, we used R Markdown to guide students through exploring mathematical models to understand the principle of herd immunity. In a Data Visualization and Communication course for biology students, we used R Markdown for teaching the fundamentals of R programming and graphing, and for students to learn to create reproducible data investigations. Through these examples, we demonstrate the benefits of R Markdown as a dynamic teaching and learning tool.

AU  - Smart, S.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics
AB  - Visualizations often encode numeric data using sequential and diverging color ramps. Effective ramps use colors that are sufficiently discriminable, align well with the data, and are aesthetically pleasing. Designers rely on years of experience to create high-quality color ramps. However, it is challenging for novice visualization developers that lack this experience to craft effective ramps as most guidelines for constructing ramps are loosely defined qualitative heuristics that are often difficult to apply. Our goal is to enable visualization developers to readily create effective color encodings using a single seed color. We do this using an algorithmic approach that models designer practices by analyzing patterns in the structure of designer-crafted color ramps. We construct these models from a corpus of 222 expert-designed color ramps, and use the results to automatically generate ramps that mimic designer practices. We evaluate our approach through an empirical study comparing the outputs of our approach with designer-crafted color ramps. Our models produce ramps that support accurate and aesthetically pleasing visualizations at least as well as designer ramps and that outperform conventional mathematical approaches.

AB  - ABSTRACTSpreadsheets are widely used software tools for data entry, storage, analysis, and visualization. Focusing on the data entry and storage aspects, this article offers practical recommendations for organizing spreadsheet data to reduce errors and ease later analyses. The basic principles are: be consistent, write dates like YYYY-MM-DD, do not leave any cells empty, put just one thing in a cell, organize the data as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row), create a data dictionary, do not include calculations in the raw data files, do not use font color or highlighting as data, choose good names for things, make backups, use data validation to avoid data entry errors, and save the data in plain text files.

AB  - As you drive into the centre of town, cars and trucks approach from several directions, and pedestrians swarm into the intersection. The wind blows a newspaper into the gutter and a pigeon does something unexpected on your windshield. This would be a demanding and stressful situation, but you would probably make it to the other side of town without mishap. Why is this situation taxing, and how do you cope?

AB  - In this article, we report that in visual search, desaturated reddish targets are much easier to find than other desaturated
targets, even when perceptual differences between targets and distractors are carefully equated. Observers searched for
desaturated targets among mixtures of white and saturated distractors. Reaction times were hundreds of milliseconds faster
for the most effective (reddish) targets than for the least effective (purplish) targets. The advantage for desaturated reds did
not reflect an advantage for the lexical category “pink,” because reaction times did not follow named color categories. Many
pink stimuli were not found quickly, and many quickly found stimuli were not labeled “pink.” Other possible explanations (e.g.,
linear-separability effects) also failed. Instead, we propose that guidance of visual search for desaturated colors is based on a
combination of low-level color-opponent signals that is different from the combinations that produce perceived color. We
speculate that this guidance might reflect a specialization for human skin.

AU  - Bilsky, A. B.

T2  - Percept Psychophys
AB  - In visual search tasks, subjects look for a target among a variable number of distractor items. If the target is defined by a conjunction of two different features (e.g., color x orientation), efficient search is possible when parallel processing of information about orientation is used to guide the deployment of attention to the target. Another type of conjunction search has targets defined by two instances of one type of feature (e.g., a conjunction of two colors). In this case, search is inefficient when the target is an item defined by parts of two different colors but much more efficient if the target can be described as a whole item of one color with a park of another color (Wolfe, Friedman-Hill, & Bilsky, 1994). In this paper, we show that the same distinction holds for size. "Part-whole" size x size conjunction searches are efficient; "part-part" searches are not (Experiments 1-3). In contrast, all orientation x orientation searches are inefficient (Experiments 4-6). This difference between preattentive processing of color and size, on the one hand, and orientation, on the other, may reflect structural relationships between features in real-world objects.

AU  - Schwabish, Jonathan A.
AB  - "Now more than ever, content must be visual if it is to travel far. Readers everywhere are overwhelmed with a flow of data, news, and text. Visuals can cut through the noise and make it easier for readers to recognize and recall information. Yet many researchers were never taught how to present their work visually. This book details essential strategies to create more effective data visualizations. Jonathan Schwabish walks readers through the steps of creating better graphs and how to move beyond simple line, bar, and pie charts. Through more than five hundred examples, he demonstrates the do's and don'ts of data visualization, the principles of visual perception, and how to make subjective style decisions around a chart's design. Schwabish surveys more than eighty visualization types, from histograms to horizon charts, ridgeline plots to choropleth maps, and explains how each has its place in the visual toolkit. It might seem intimidating, but everyone can learn how to create compelling, effective data visualizations. This book will guide you as you define your audience and goals, choose the graph that best fits for your data, and clearly communicate your message"--

AB  - Lake Dian, the largest lake on South China’s Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, exhibits two abnormal funnel-like features in the deepest part of the lake. Nevertheless, how and when these funnels formed and their implications and potential environmental and ecological effects remain unclear. To address these questions, we carried out a detailed multi-method survey including underwater topographic monitoring, extraction of sediment records, and geophysical exploration across the funnel areas. Sediment records revealed a significant sedimentation hiatus around these features. For example, sediments with thicknesses of ca. 69.24 cm and 83.56 cm in cores D4 and D6 were eroded based on the calculated of sedimentation rates. Deformed sedimentary structures and a hiatus, together with large-scale funnel-shaped topography, prove that underlying karst collapse may trigger massive water outflow through these funnels, which could result in an erosional hiatus in the local lakebed. Continuous clay deposits in the upper part of the sedimentary column suggest that water leakage may have ceased since the 1930s. However, bathymetric surveys conducted in October 2015 and September 2019 indicated that the maximum lake depth increased by 0.97 m and 0.2 m in the large and small funnels, respectively, over this 4-year period. The corresponding increased volumes were 1520 m3 and 375 m3 in the large and small funnels, respectively. Numerous pits were distributed around the funnels. Cumulatively, these underwater topographic changes reveal that small-scale, slow water leakage has been developing, which could potentially trigger catastrophic water discharge due to increasing hydraulic pressure and/or underlying karstification. If catastrophic water outflow occurs, ~14.05 × 108 m3 of highly polluted water would not only contaminate the upper reaches of the large river and/or the lake itself, but would also endanger regional water security and induce widespread negative ecological impacts.

T2  - Cartographic Journal
AB  - Choosing effective colour schemes for thematic maps is surprisingly difficult. Color Brewer is an online tool designed to take some of the guesswork out of this process by helping users select appropriate colour schemes for their specific mapping needs by considering: the number of data classes; the nature of their data (matched with sequential, diverging and qualitative schemes): and the end-use environment for the map (e.g., CRT, LCD, printed, projected, photocopied). ColorBrewer contains 'learn more' tutorials to help guide users, prompts them to test-drive colour schemes as both map and legend, and provides output in five colour specification systems.

TI  - Tidy Data
AU  - Wickham, Hadley
T2  - Journal of Statistical Software
AB  - A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.

It provides a constructive understanding of how to use data visualization to convey meaning and narrative, as well as how to leverage data visualization for persuasion. Producing effective data visualizations starts with obtaining good data in the first place, as well as being able to manage that data so that it is in a format that is usable for analysis. Keeping track of the history of interactions and providing a mechanism to backtrack or undo the changes are important in interactive visualization. Storyboarding has become such an important part of data visualization that many software tools support their construction directly, including tools like Processing . The most common applications of scientific visualization involve visualizing the results of solutions to differential equation modeling of some kind.

T2  - Measuring colour
AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the colorimetric procedures. The gamut of chromaticities that can be matched with a set of three colour matching stimuli is defined in the chapter by the triangle formed by the three points representing them in a chromaticity diagram. Having defined the chromaticities of the three matching primaries, and the units in which they are to be measured, the colorimetric system is complete, and the amounts of red, green, and blue light needed to match any colour are the tristimulus values, R,G,B, in the system. If the red, green, and blue primaries are used to match equal amounts of power per small constant-width wavelength interval throughout the spectrum, the results constitute a set of colour-matching functions. When television and computer displays are being used, it is necessary, for critical work, to check the characteristics of the display. Controlled Vocabulary Terms computer displays; image matching; monochromators

Covers the principles of colour measurement rather than a guide to instruments. Provides the reader with the basic facts needed to measure colour. Describes and explains the interactions between how colour is affected by the type of lighting, by the nature of the objects illuminated, and by the properties of the colour vision of observers. Includes many worked examples, and a series of Appendices provides the numerical data needed in many colorimetric calculations. The addition of 4th edition co-author, Dr. Pointer, has facilitated the inclusion of extensive practical advice on measurement procedures and the latest CIE recommendations"-- "This book is intended to provide the reader with the basic facts needed to measure colour.

AB  - The results are described of a study of morphometric variation among populations of the mountain brushtail possum, Trichosurus caninus Ogilby. Trapping surveys were completed at seven sites from southern Victoria to central Queensland. The variables measured from each of the 102 animals captured included head length, skull width, total body length, tail length, pes length, length of the ear conch, body girth, belly girth and the pelage colour. Canonical variate analysis highlighted the existence of a marked separation between populations in Victoria and those in New South Wales and Queensland. The first canonical variate accounted for 89% of the variation between the populations and was dominated by the length of the ear conch, tail length and pes length. There also were differences between the populations for several other morphometric measures including the head and body length. We recorded considerable variation in the fur colour of T. caninus both within and between the populations surveyed. However, no consistent pattern in the geographic variation of fur coloration was evident. We do not know the ecological or evolutionary causes underlying the observed differences in morphological characteristics amongst the populations of T. caninus. Further work is planned to examine the genetic variability of the populations and to assess the taxonomic significance of our findings.

AB  - Abstract
            The accurate representation of data is essential in science communication. However, colour maps that visually distort data through uneven colour gradients or are unreadable to those with colour-vision deficiency remain prevalent in science. These include, but are not limited to, rainbow-like and red–green colour maps. Here, we present a simple guide for the scientific use of colour. We show how scientifically derived colour maps report true data variations, reduce complexity, and are accessible for people with colour-vision deficiencies. We highlight ways for the scientific community to identify and prevent the misuse of colour in science, and call for a proactive step away from colour misuse among the community, publishers, and the press.

Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience with modeling, this practical introduction shows data analysts, business analysts, and data scientists how the tidymodels framework offers a consistent, flexible approach for your work. RStudio engineers Max Kuhn and Julia Silge demonstrate ways to create models by focusing on an R dialect called the tidyverse. Software that adops tidyverse principles shares both a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so learning one piece of the ecosystem makes it easier to learn the next. You'll understand why the tidymodels framework has been built to be used by a broad range of people

T2  - Better data visualizations
T3  - A guide for scholars, researchers, and wonks
AB  - The graphs in this chapter are intended to help our readers compare values across categories. Bars, lines, and dots can all let our readers compare within and between groups. In some cases, we want our reader to see both levels ¡em¿and¡/em¿ change, or some other variable combination; in other cases, we want to focus their attention on one comparison or another. The challenge when comparing categorical data is deciding what we want the chart to convey. Is there a primary argument or story? Is there something you can identify as the most important comparison you want the reader to make?

T2  - Annual Review of Biomedical Data Science
AB  - The rapid increase in volume and complexity of biomedical data requires changes in research, communication, and clinical practices. This includes learning how to effectively integrate automated analysis with high–data density visualizations that clearly express complex phenomena. In this review, we summarize key principles and resources from data visualization research that help address this difficult challenge. We then survey how visualization is being used in a selection of emerging biomedical research areas, including three-dimensional genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the protein structure universe, phosphoproteomics, augmented reality–assisted surgery, and metagenomics. While specific research areas need highly tailored visualizations, there are common challenges that can be addressed with general methods and strategies. Also common, however, are poor visualization practices. We outline ongoing initiatives aimed at improving visualization practices in biomedical research via better tools, peer-to-peer learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration with computer scientists, science communicators, and graphic designers. These changes are revolutionizing how we see and think about our data.

TI  - Tidy modeling with R: a framework for modeling in the tidyverse
AU  - Kuhn, Max
AU  - Silge, Julia
AB  - Get going with tidymodels, a collection of R packges for modeling and machine learning. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience with modeling, this practical introduction shows data analysts, business analysts, and data scientists how the tidymodels framework offers a consistent, flexible approach for your work. RStudio engineers Max Kuhn and Julia Silge demonstrate ways to create models by focusing on an R dialect called the tidyverse. Software that adops tidyverse principles shares both a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so learning one piece of the ecosystem makes it easier to learn the next. You'll understand why the tidymodels framework has been built to be used by a broad range of people

AB  - Many areas of research suffer from poor reproducibility, particularly in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components-a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines-to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly.

AB  - The field of ecology is poised to take advantage of emerging technologies that facilitate the gathering, analyzing, and sharing of data, methods, and results. The concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers, constitutes ?open science.? Despite the many benefits of an open approach to science, a number of barriers to entry exist that may prevent researchers from embracing openness in their own work. Here we describe several key shifts in mindset that underpin the transition to more open science. These shifts in mindset include thinking about data stewardship rather than data ownership, embracing transparency throughout the data life-cycle and project duration, and accepting critique in public. Though foreign and perhaps frightening at first, these changes in thinking stand to benefit the field of ecology by fostering collegiality and broadening access to data and findings. We present an overview of tools and best practices that can enable these shifts in mindset at each stage of the research process, including tools to support data management planning and reproducible analyses, strategies for soliciting constructive feedback throughout the research process, and methods of broadening access to final research products.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics
AB  - Students who eat breakfast more frequently tend to have a higher grade point average. From this data, many people might confidently state that a before-school breakfast program would lead to higher grades. This is a reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation - X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments, we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data. High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.

TI  - Variation of Saturation Across Hue Affects Unique and Typical Hue Choices
AU  - Witzel, C
T2  - I-PERCEPTION
AB  - Most studies on colour categorisation and many studies on unique hues have used samples of maximally saturated Munsell chips that vary in saturation across hue. Here we show that observers' choices of category prototypes and unique hues depend on the variation of Munsell chroma across hue. Both unique hue and prototype choices were shifted towards the more saturated hues in the respective stimulus set. This effect of saturation may explain cross-cultural regularities in colour categorisation. More generally, these findings highlight the importance of controlling saturation when measuring colour categories and unique hues.

TI  - “Categorical Perception” and Linguistic Categorization of Color
AU  - Ocelák, Radek
T2  - Review of Philosophy and Psychology
AB  - This paper offers a conceptual clarification of the phenomenon commonly referred to as categorical perception of color, both in adults and in infants. First, I argue against the common notion of categorical perception as involving a distortion of the perceptual color space. The effects observed in the categorical perception research concern categorical discrimination performance and the underlying processing; they need not directly reflect the relations of color similarity and difference. Moreover, the methodology of the research actually presupposes that the relations of similarity and difference do not vary with languages. The observed categorical perception effects should be conceived independently of the perceptual color space. Second, I challenge the usual opinion that the existing evidence on infant “categorical perception” allows us to conclude that infants perceptually categorize color, and in particular, that they have perceptual categories that resemble the basic color categories of English. Such conclusions rest on an unjustified interpretation of the infant “categorical perception” findings in terms of adult linguistic categorical boundaries. Based on the suggested new understanding, I propose that the phenomenon, as present in infants, should be conceived and examined as a possible explanatory factor with respect to the existing patterns of color naming in languages of the world.

AB  - Summary Visual systems first evolved not to enable animals to perceive the world, but to provide distal sensory control of their movements. Conscious sight is a relatively recent invention, but its emergence has enabled organisms such as humans and other primates to carry out complex cognitive operations on a detailed perceptual representation of the world. The two streams of visual processing that have been identified in the primate cerebral cortex are a reflection of these two functions of vision. The dorsal 'action' stream projecting from early visual areas to the posterior parietal cortex mediates the visual control of skilled motor acts. The ventral 'perceptual' stream projecting from early visual areas to the temporal lobe provides a perceptual experience of the world beyond our bodies. Both streams work together in the production of adaptive behavior.

AB  - Attention is a central theme in cognitive science - it exemplifies the links between the brain and behaviour, and binds psychology to the techniques of neuroscience. A visionary model suggested by Michael Posner described attention as a set of independent control networks. This challenged the previously held view of attention as a uniform concept. The idea that disparate attentional networks correlate with discrete neural circuitry and can be influenced by focal brain injuries, mental state and specific drugs has since been supported by converging data from several modern methodologies. Given the recent explosion in empirical data, attentional typologies provide powerful conceptual tools with which to contextualize and integrate these findings.

T2  - Trends in Cognitive Sciences
AB  - Traces the history of the "cognitive revolution" in psychology from the author's perspective. Cognitive science is a child of the 1950s, the product of a time when psychology, anthropology and linguistics were redefining themselves and computer science and neuroscience as disciplines were coming into existence. It is suggested that psychology could not participate in the cognitive revolution until it had freed itself from behaviorism, thus restoring cognition to scientific respectability. By then, it was becoming clear in several disciplines that the solution to some of their problems depended crucially on solving problems traditionally allocated to other disciplines. Issues discussed related to this collaboration include the limitations of information theory, and interdisciplinary activities in the fields of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, computer science, anthropology and philosophy.

T2  - Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience
AB  - In recent years, three attentional networks have been defined in anatomical and functional terms. These functions involve alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Reaction time measures can be used to quantify the processing efficiency within each of these three networks. The Attention Network Test (ANT) is designed to evaluate alerting, orienting, and executive attention within a single 30-min testing session that can be easily performed by children, patients, and monkeys. A study with 40 normal adult subjects indicates that the ANT produces reliable single subject estimates of alerting, orienting, and executive function, and further suggests that the efficiencies of these three networks are uncorrelated. There are, however, some interactions in which alerting and orienting can modulate the degree of interference from flankers. This procedure may prove to be convenient and useful in evaluating attentional abnormalities associated with cases of brain injury, stroke, schizophrenia, and attention-deficit disorder. The ANT may also serve as an activation task for neuroimaging studies and as a phenotype for the study of the influence of genes on attentional networks.

TI  - Orienting of Attention
AU  - Posner, Michael I.
T2  - Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology
AB  - Bartlett viewed thinking as a high level skill exhibiting ballistic properties that he called its ?point of no return?. This paper explores one aspect of cognition through the use of a simple model task in which human subjects are asked to commit attention to a position in visual space other than fixation. This instruction is executed by orienting a covert (attentional) mechanism that seems sufficiently time locked to external events that its trajectory can be traced across the visual field in terms of momentary changes in the efficiency of detecting stimuli. A comparison of results obtained with alert monkeys, brain injured and normal human subjects shows the relationship of this covert system to saccadic eye movements and to various brain systems controlling perception and motion. In accordance with Bartlett's insight, the possibility is explored that similar principles apply to orienting of attention toward sensory input and orienting to the semantic structures used in thinking.

TI  - Reconsidering Visual Search
AU  - Kristjansson, A
T2  - I-PERCEPTION
AB  - The visual search paradigm has had an enormous impact in many fields. A theme running through this literature has been the distinction between preattentive and attentive processing, which I refer to as the two-stage assumption. Under this assumption, slopes of set-size and response time are used to determine whether attention is needed for a given task or not. Even though a lot of findings question this two-stage assumption, it still has enormous influence, determining decisions on whether papers are published or research funded. The results described here show that the two-stage assumption leads to very different conclusions about the operation of attention for identical search tasks based only on changes in response (presence/absence versus Go/No-go responses). Slopes are therefore an ambiguous measure of attentional involvement. Overall, the results suggest that the two-stage model cannot explain all findings on visual search, and they highlight how slopes of response time and set-size should only be used with caution.

TI  - Guided Search 6.0: An updated model of visual search
AU  - Wolfe, JM
T2  - PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW
AB  - This paper describes Guided Search 6.0 (GS6), a revised model of visual search. When we encounter a scene, we can see something everywhere. However, we cannot recognize more than a few items at a time. Attention is used to select items so that their features can be "bound" into recognizable objects. Attention is "guided" so that items can be processed in an intelligent order. In GS6, this guidance comes from five sources of preattentive information: (1) top-down and (2) bottom-up feature guidance, (3) prior history (e.g., priming), (4) reward, and (5) scene syntax and semantics. These sources are combined into a spatial "priority map," a dynamic attentional landscape that evolves over the course of search. Selective attention is guided to the most active location in the priority map approximately 20 times per second. Guidance will not be uniform across the visual field. It will favor items near the point of fixation. Three types of functional visual field (FVFs) describe the nature of these foveal biases. There is a resolution FVF, an FVF governing exploratory eye movements, and an FVF governing covert deployments of attention. To be identified as targets or rejected as distractors, items must be compared to target templates held in memory. The binding and recognition of an attended object is modeled as a diffusion process taking > 150 ms/item. Since selection occurs more frequently than that, it follows that multiple items are undergoing recognition at the same time, though asynchronously, making GS6 a hybrid of serial and parallel processes. In GS6, if a target is not found, search terminates when an accumulating quitting signal reaches a threshold. Setting of that threshold is adaptive, allowing feedback about performance to shape subsequent searches. Simulation shows that the combination of asynchronous diffusion and a quitting signal can produce the basic patterns of response time and error data from a range of search experiments.

TI  - Defending Yarbus: Eye movements reveal observers' task
AU  - Borji, Ali
AU  - Itti, Laurent
T2  - Journal of Vision
AB  - In a very influential yet anecdotal illustration, Yarbus suggested that human eye-movement patterns are modulated top down by different task demands. While the hypothesis that it is possible to decode the observer's task from eye movements has received some support (e.g., Henderson, Shinkareva, Wang, Luke, &amp; Olejarczyk, 2013; Iqbal &amp; Bailey, 2004), Greene, Liu, and Wolfe (2012) argued against it by reporting a failure. In this study, we perform a more systematic investigation of this problem, probing a larger number of experimental factors than previously. Our main goal is to determine the informativeness of eye movements for task and mental state decoding. We perform two experiments. In the first experiment, we reanalyze the data from a previous study by Greene et al. (2012) and contrary to their conclusion, we report that it is possible to decode the observer's task from aggregate eye-movement features slightly but significantly above chance, using a Boosting classifier (34.12% correct vs. 25% chance level; binomial test, p = 1.0722e – 04). In the second experiment, we repeat and extend Yarbus's original experiment by collecting eye movements of 21 observers viewing 15 natural scenes (including Yarbus's scene) under Yarbus's seven questions. We show that task decoding is possible, also moderately but significantly above chance (24.21% vs. 14.29% chance-level; binomial test, p = 2.4535e – 06). We thus conclude that Yarbus's idea is supported by our data and continues to be an inspiration for future computational and experimental eye-movement research. From a broader perspective, we discuss techniques, features, limitations, societal and technological impacts, and future directions in task decoding from eye movements.

T2  - Vision Research
AB  - A biologically motivated computational model of bottom-up visual selective attention was used to examine the degree to which stimulus salience guides the allocation of attention. Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions.

AU  - Itti, Laurent

T2  - Vision Research
AB  - Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements or covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map, that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be tested.

AU  - Kristjánsson, Árni

T2  - Attention, Perception and Psychophysics, suppl. A Special Issue in Honor of the Contributions of Anne Treisman
AB  - Anne Treisman's Feature Integration Theory (FIT) is a landmark in cognitive psychology and vision research. While many have discussed how Treisman's theory has fared since it was first proposed, it is less common to approach FIT from the other side in time: to examine what experimental findings, theoretical concepts, and ideas inspired it. The theory did not enter into a theoretical vacuum. Treisman's ideas were inspired by a large literature on a number of topics within visual psychophysics, cognitive psychology, and visual neurophysiology. Several key ideas developed contemporaneously within these fields that inspired FIT, and the theory involved an attempt at integrating them. Our aim here was to highlight the conceptual problems, experimental findings, and theoretical positions that Treisman was responding to with her theory and that the theory was intended to explain. We review a large number of findings from the decades preceding the proposal of feature integration theory showing how the theory integrated many ideas that developed in parallel within neurophysiology, visual psychophysics, and cognitive psychology. Our conclusion is that FIT made sense of many preceding findings, integrating them in an elegant way within a single theoretical account.

AU  - Paff, Matthew L.

AU  - Wilke, Claus O.
AB  - Abstract
          Attenuated viruses have numerous applications, in particular in the context of live viral vaccines. However, purposefully designing attenuated viruses remains challenging, in particular if the attenuation is meant to be resistant to rapid evolutionary recovery. Here we develop and analyze a new attenuation method, promoter ablation, using an established viral model, bacteriophage T7. Ablating promoters of the two most highly expressed T7 proteins (scaffold and capsid) led to major reductions in transcript abundance of the affected genes, with the effect of the double knockout approximately additive of the effects of single knockouts. Fitness reduction was moderate and also approximately additive; fitness recovery on extended adaptation was partial and did not restore the promoters. The fitness effect of promoter knockouts combined with a previously tested codon deoptimization of the capsid gene was less than additive, as anticipated from their competing mechanisms of action. In one design, the engineering created an unintended consequence that led to further attenuation, the effect of which was studied and understood in hindsight. Overall, the mechanisms and effects of genome engineering on attenuation behaved in a predictable manner. Therefore, this work suggests that the rational design of viral attenuation methods is becoming feasible.
          
            Importance
            Live viral vaccines rely on attenuated viruses that can successfully infect their host but have reduced fitness or virulence. Such attenuated viruses were originally developed through trial- and-error, typically by adaptation of the wild-type virus to novel conditions. That method was haphazard, with no way of controlling the degree of attenuation, the number of attenuating mutations, or preventing evolutionary reversion. Synthetic biology now enables rational design and engineering of viral attenuation, but rational design must be informed by biological principles to achieve stable, quantitative attenuation. This work shows that in a model system for viral attenuation, bacteriophage T7, attenuation can be obtained from rational design principles, and multiple different attenuation approaches can be combined for enhanced overall effect.

AB  - Blood hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, red cell count, white cell count (WBC), and plasma ferritin concentration were measured on 1604 occasions from 706 nationally ranked athletes in 12 sports. The blood samples were taken from a forearm vein amidst periods of moderate to intense training but at least 6 h after a training session. A multiple regression model, accounting for correlations between variables and incorporating the categorical variables of sex and sport revealed the following. Each blood variable was found to be dependent on body mass index, (mass/height2, BMI), with the exception of WBC in the males. As BMI increased so did the magnitude of these blood variables (P less than 0.01). Each blood variable was also dependent on the sport (P less than 0.01), significant differences being observed between several sports in each case. Furthermore, as has been previously reported, the magnitude of the blood variables was dependent on the sex of the athlete, each being significantly greater in males (P less than 0.01), with the exception of the WBC, which was greater in females (P less than 0.01). These data indicate that the rationality of interpreting the hematology in highly trained athletes may be increased by taking BMI and sport into account, as well as gender.

In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area) is proportional to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801.
Pie charts are very widely used in the business world and the mass media. However, they have been criticized, and many experts recommend avoiding them, as research has shown it is more difficult to make simple comparisons such as the size of different sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across different pie charts. Some research has shown pie charts perform well for comparing complex combinations of sections (e.g., "A + B vs. C + D"). Commonly recommended alternatives to pie charts in most cases include bar charts, box plots, and dot plots.

AB  - Outcomes of high-throughput biological experiments are typically interpreted by statistical testing for enriched gene functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology (GO). The resulting lists of GO terms may be large and highly redundant, and thus difficult to interpret. REVIGO is a Web server that summarizes long, unintelligible lists of GO terms by finding a representative subset of the terms using a simple clustering algorithm that relies on semantic similarity measures. Furthermore, REVIGO visualizes this non-redundant GO term set in multiple ways to assist in interpretation: multidimensional scaling and graph-based visualizations accurately render the subdivisions and the semantic relationships in the data, while treemaps and tag clouds are also offered as alternative views. REVIGO is freely available at http://revigo. irb.hr/.

The key is to organize first—outlining, writing, sketching, and drawing. This is not to say that you won't revise and edit your slides as you progress. In fact, you may find that building a draft of your slides and then changing, correcting, adding, and subtracting helps you get to a final version. Ultimately, you may decide you don't want to physically write or sketch a draft, but I encourage you to embrace the philosophy of planning your presentation before

AB  - Inducing sleep in flies reverses deficits in long-term memory caused by social enrichment.
          , 
            
              Sleep is believed to play an important role in memory consolidation. We induced sleep on demand by expressing the temperature-gated nonspecific cation channel
              Transient receptor potential cation channel
              (
              UAS-TrpA1
              ) in neurons, including those with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (FB). When the temperature was raised to 31°C, flies entered a quiescent state that meets the criteria for identifying sleep. When sleep was induced for 4 hours after a massed-training protocol for courtship conditioning that is not capable of inducing long-term memory (LTM) by itself, flies develop an LTM. Activating the dorsal FB in the absence of sleep did not result in the formation of LTM after massed training.

AB  - Abstract
          Oscillatory neural dynamics are an inseparable part of mammalian sleep. Characteristic rhythms are associated with different sleep stages and variable levels of sleep pressure, but it remains unclear whether these oscillations are passive mirrors or active generators of sleep. Here we report that sleep-control neurons innervating the dorsal fan-shaped body of Drosophila (dFBNs) produce slow-wave activity (SWA) in the delta frequency band (0.2–2 Hz) that is causally linked to sleep. The dFBN ensemble contains rhythmic cells whose membrane voltages oscillate in anti-phase between hyperpolarized DOWN and depolarized UP states releasing bursts of action potentials. The oscillations rely on direct interhemispheric competition of two inhibitory half-centers connected by glutamatergic synapses. Interference with glutamate release from dFBNs disrupts SWA and baseline as well as rebound sleep, while the optogenetic replay of SWA (with the help of intersectional, dFBN-restricted drivers) induces sleep. dFBNs generate SWA throughout the sleep–wake cycle— despite a mutually antagonistic ‘flip-flop’ arrangement with arousing dopaminergic neurons—but adjust its power to sleep need via an interplay of sleep history-dependent increases in excitability and homeostatic depression of their efferent synapses, as we demonstrate transcriptionally, structurally, functionally, and with a simple computational model. The oscillatory format permits a durable encoding of sleep pressure over long time scales but requires downstream mechanisms that convert the amplitude-modulated periodic signal into binary sleep–wake states.

            A protein complex zippers mitochondria to endoplasmic reticulum for phospholipid transfer.
          , 
            Communication between organelles is an important feature of all eukaryotic cells. To uncover components involved in mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions, we screened for mutants that could be complemented by a synthetic protein designed to artificially tether the two organelles. We identified the Mmm1/Mdm10/Mdm12/Mdm34 complex as a molecular tether between ER and mitochondria. The tethering complex was composed of proteins resident of both ER and mitochondria. With the use of genome-wide mapping of genetic interactions, we showed that the components of the tethering complex were functionally connected to phospholipid biosynthesis and calcium-signaling genes. In mutant cells, phospholipid biosynthesis was impaired. The tethering complex localized to discrete foci, suggesting that discrete sites of close apposition between ER and mitochondria facilitate interorganelle calcium and phospholipid exchange.

              , forms a dynamic lipid peroxidation memory. Information is stored in the oxidation state of Hyperkinetic’s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, which changes when lipid-derived carbonyls

              suggests that sleep protects neuronal membranes against oxidative damage. Indeed, brain phospholipids are depleted of vulnerable polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains after enforced waking, and slowing the removal of their carbonylic breakdown products increases the demand for sleep.

AB  - Besides the cytochrome
              c
              pathway, plant mitochondria have an alternative respiratory pathway that is comprised of a single homodimeric protein, alternative oxidase (AOX). Transgenic cultured tobacco cells with altered levels of AOX were used to test the hypothesis that the alternative pathway in plant mitochondria functions as a mechanism to decrease the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during respiratory electron transport. Using the ROS-sensitive probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, we found that antisense suppression of AOX resulted in cells with a significantly higher level of ROS compared with wild-type cells, whereas the overexpression of AOX resulted in cells with lower ROS abundance. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy showed that the difference in ROS abundance among wild-type and AOX transgenic cells was caused by changes in mitochondrial-specific ROS formation. Mitochondrial ROS production was exacerbated by the use of antimycin A, which inhibited normal cytochrome electron transport. In addition, cells overexpressing AOX were found to have consistently lower expression of genes encoding ROS-scavenging enzymes, including the superoxide dismutase genes
              SodA
              and
              SodB
              , as well as glutathione peroxidase. Also, the abundance of mRNAs encoding salicylic acid-binding catalase and a pathogenesis-related protein were significantly higher in cells deficient in AOX. These results are evidence that AOX plays a role in lowering mitochondrial ROS formation in plant cells.
